Nashville is a growing city and with that comes stress on our infrastructure. Is there a need to improve and upgrade our public transportation? How does Nashville compare to other cities in similar size and trajectory? Is it worth it? These are some of the questions I will try to answer.

### **Motivation**   
I moved to Nashville in 2016, and have watched it grow quickly. As more people moved here, the traffic has increased and commutes have gotten longer. I believe that there needs to be more investment in our infrastructure, specifically public transportation. I have travelled to cities around the US as well as abroad, and I'm amazed by some of the public transportations systems out there. Places like Japan heavily rely on their public transportation. It is reliable and efficient.

### **Data Questions**   
* Does Nashville need to invest more into public transportation?
* Looking at cities similar size to Nashville, what do their public transportation look like?
* What are the ridership metrics for these cities?
* What are the costs for building and operating these systems?
* What are the benefits? Return on investment?
* Looking at cities that are larger, what is in store for us down the road?
